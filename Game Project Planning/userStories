As a player I want the game to automatically end when a player has
claimed three squares in a vertical, horizontal or vertical row
so I know to stop playing

as a player I want to be able to see the scores of my past games so
I can show them to friends

as a developer I want to be able to see users and their last log in
date so I can see how many people have played the game recently

As a player I want to be able to log into an account so I can
save my game data.
